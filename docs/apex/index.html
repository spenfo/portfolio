Apex Legends is an Online Multiplayer First Person Shooter Battle Royale game
created by EA and released initially in Feburuary of 2019. What many people
like about Apex Legends is that it is free and cross-platform, meaning you can
play with your friends no matter what system they play on. There are many things
that make Apex Legends stand out in the world of Battle Royale games and we will
discuss those unique quilities and dive into the basics of the game here.

<h2>Who are "Legends" anyway?</h2>

Legends are the playable characters in Apex Legends. There are 19 Legends as 
of the writing of this article and each one has a unique backstory and special
 abilities in game. Pictured above is the Legend called Pathfinder
 (my personal favorite). You can click on the picture of Pathfinder to learn 
 more about their backstory and 
unique abilities. Having so many playable characters means that Apex Legends
is never the same twice. You'll always have to stay on your toes because you 
never know who you'll be facing! Click

to learn more about all of the
Legends and their abilities so you'll be ready for anything.

<h2>How do I play?</h2>

<p>
Apex Legends is a Battle Royale, so that means it's you and your team against
a bunch of other teams. Last team standing wins! First, you'll choose your 
legend. Then, you'll drop into the 
<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/maps#battle-royale"
title="Go to EA's summary of the maps"
target="_blank">map</a>
 with your team. Stay with them so you
have a better chance at a fight when you run into other teams. Once you reach
the ground you'll first want to look for a weapon. There are many types of 
weapons but at the beginning of the game you just need to take whatever you can
find! The weapons in Apex Legends are broken into siz categories based on what 
ammo type they use. Each category has a color so you'll want to look for ammo
with the corresponding color around the map as well.
</p>
<p>
You'll also want to keep an eye out for healing items as well. You're gonna
get hurt, so you need to keep your health and shield topped off if you want
to make it to the top. There are five total healing items which we will list
below. If you're not actively in a fight, you should heal yourself if you
need it!
