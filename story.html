One morning NAME1 was woken up by NAME2 shouting at the top of their lungs. "NAME1!!!" NAME2 shouted. "You're going to be late to school AGAIN!!!" NAME1 looked at their CLOCK clock and read the time. '7:53 already, huh,' NAME1 thought. 'How am I going to make it all the way to farOff High in only 7 minutes?'

NAME1 hurried and put on their CLOTHES and ran down stairs. NAME1 grabbed some FOOD and sprinted out the door. 'Isn't there any way I can just fly to school?' NAME1 thought. Just then, across the street, there was a FAST WHEELS with a sign that said "Free" on it. "Nice!" NAME1 yelled, grabbing the FAST WHEELS. In less than TIME seconds NAME1 had arrived at school. Everyone cheered them on as they burst through the doors riding their new FAST WHEELS.
